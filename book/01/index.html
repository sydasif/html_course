    <h2>Network Automation</h2>
    <p>
      Network automation is a process of automating a computer networkâ€™s
      configuration, management and operations. The tasks that were usually done
      by the network or system administrator can be automated using several
      tools and technologies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scripting languages are widely used by Network Engineers and System
      administrators for automating tasks. This saves time, and effort and
      thereby reducing human errors as well. Among the automation tools, Python
      and Ansible are the most popular ones. With Software Defined Networking
      (SDN) in picture, knowing any of these programming languages is vital for
      the future of administering the network and systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a significant change in the networking industry which is driving
      networking engineers and organizations to adopt the concepts and ideas of
      network programmability and automation. To cater for the need for
      organizational competitiveness, it is highly recommended that networking
      professionals learn the scripting languages and protocols as required for
      a new skill set.
