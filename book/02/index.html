    <h2>Data Types</h2>
    <p>
      This chapter focuses on the basic fundamentals of the Python programming
      language that are needed to write a program or a script. Python has
      different data types, sets, strings, lists and dictionaries that are
      important in programming. Lists store sequences of objects in an order and
      iterate over the list.
    </p>
    <p>
      Variables in Python mainly refer to the storage location. These variables
      can be assigned one or more values. Python also has several data types
      including numeric data types. There are also a set of characters called
      strings that are contained in Python.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lists in Python are sequences of ordered elements that are mutable. Sets,
      on the other hand, are Python collections of unordered elements that are
      immutable. Tuples are also Python elements that describe immutable objects
      but use parenthesis.
    </p>
    <p>
      All these elements of Python programming work together in meeting the
      needs of different programmers in the programming work. These elements
      help in creating effective Python programs used in several applications.

        Python data type is a group of values that belong to one of the groups
        shown below:

      <ul>
        <li>Collections</li>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Sequences
            <ul>
              <li>Strings</li>
              <li>List</li>
              <li>Tuples</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Mapping

            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Float</li>
          <li>Complex</li>
        </ol>
        <li>None</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>

    <p>
      In this chapter, we discuss variables, strings, numbers, built-in
      function, Boolean values and operators.
