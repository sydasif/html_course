### HTML Document Structure

Following is an example of an basic HTML document.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

   <head>
      <!-- Title of page -->
      <title>Html Tutorial</title>
   </head>

   <body>
      <!--1st heading -->
      <h1>Basic HTML Document</h1>
      <!--Paragraph and content goes here -->
      <p>Hello World!</p>
   </body>

</html>
```

## HTML Tags

HTML is a markup language that uses tags to format the content. These tags are enclosed within angle braces `<Tag Name>`. Most of the tags have their corresponding closing tags. For example, `<html>` has its closing tag `</html>` etc.

The above example of an HTML document uses the following tags:

| Sr.No | Tag | Description |
| ----- | ----| ----------- |
| 1 | `<!DOCTYPE...>` | This tag defines the document type and HTML version. |
| 2 | `<html>` | This tag encloses the complete HTML document |
| 3 | `<head>` | This tag represents the document's header which can keep other HTML tags. |
| 4 | `<title>` | The `<title>` tag is used inside the `<head>` tag to mention the document title. |
| 5 | `<body>` | This tag represents the document's body which keeps all other HTML tags. |
| 6 | `<h1>` | This tag represents the heading. |
| 7 | `<p>` | This tag represents a paragraph. |
